SVExchange hatch request

Hey! I just got an egg that matches your Trainer Shiny Value. Can I trade you the egg so you can hatch it and trade it back? My friend code is 2552-0307-9433 and my IGN is Cranderveldt. 

I have already added you. Feel free to message me back to coordinate timing. I don't want a nickname and I don't have any hatch location preferences. Thanks in advance!





Absolutely, what's your FC and IGN? Mine is 2552-0307-9433, Cranderveldt. Do you have a nickname request or a specific place you'd like me to hatch the egg?
